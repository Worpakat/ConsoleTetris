# ConsoleTetris
Tetris Game as Console App
This was made an exercise for basic threading and OOP.
Made on January 2021 in one week.
Because of I didn't know how synchronize threads, can be block drawing problems at runtime.
And because of I didn't have enough time, I couldn't make a point counter or some restart option etc. :D
Have Fun!

How to Play:
    Rotate Shape: SpaceBar
    Movement: Arrow Keys

!ATTENTION FOR EMPLOYERS! : Because of I made this program for exercise that time, I did not type comments in English but Turkish. I can use English for comments. :)
